The Haiku model is an open-source machine learning model developed by DeepMind. Specifically, it is a language model designed for natural language processing tasks. Haiku is built using JAX, a numerical computing library, and provides a neural network library with a focus on modularity and ease of use. It is part of the broader JAX ecosystem and is particularly useful for researchers and developers working on machine learning projects.
